# CRUDproject

This Project was Created by Brian Ipock

This project simulates the business/client side of a website that is listing international healthcare facilities and physicians that 
perform plastic surgery.  The functionality will will store all of the pertinant data by Procedure, Country, Facility, Physician
This will help guide the patient on where they can have the procedure of their choice.  This basic buildout of the backend or Client Side
Simulate a database of Objects that represent procedures and places acrouse the world where a user could research places for surgery abroad.





Using Java, Spring, and CSS


In the future I would like to build this out so it includes several more User oriented features, the first would a a user login
so that their could be a profile created.  Then their would be a message board where patients could discuss thier experience

This would also lead to a patient rating system based on several factors pertinant to the quality of the procedure as well as a section
on the qualitative aspects of travel abroad for surgery.  

I would also like to include a richer interface for the client where they could upload videos of their facilites, interview with their doctors
and a way communicate directly with patients that are interested in their Plastic surgery services.

As for the User/Client interaction I would like to be able to contact users that want to travel to certain facilities and be able to 
intermediate that relationship between the User/Client.

Ultimately I would want the build out to be hosted in multiple languages, Mainly Mandarin and Russian.


Some of the stumbling points revolved around know what exactly to do outside of the general 13 point framework.  I felt that I could
set up the basics of the Dynamic Web Project, but know what code I needed to write to gain the functionality I wanted.

I still am strugling how to identify errors in my code/logic, and the ability to independently find the solutions with available resources
I am still weak on knowing how/where to use available resources to resolve complier/runtime errors.

I am still needing alot of structure to be able to complete these assignments, I need someone to tell me what I need to do and show
me how to do specific elements of the projects.  I equate this to telling a child to paint a picture, more often than not those pictures
look horrible, it is not untill many elements are put together in the mind with the accompanying skillsets that true artistry can be acheived
I am still far from begining the process of creating art.
